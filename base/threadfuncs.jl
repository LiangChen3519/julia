"""
    Threads.foreach(f, channel::Channel; ntasks=Threads.nthreads())

Similar to `foreach(f, channel)`, but iteration over `channel` and calls to
`f` are split across `ntasks` Tasks spawned by `Threads.@spawn`. This function
will wait for all internally spawned tasks to complete before returning.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.
